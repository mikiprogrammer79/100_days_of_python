Day 1 is about printing, commenting, debugging, string manipulation and variables.
print(“Hello World”) -> It will print in the console the string of characters.
Print Modifiers:
    - print("A 'single quote' inside a double quote")
    - print('A "double quote" inside a single quote')
    - print("Otherwise \"escape the quote\" inside a double quote")

String concatenation: stringA + StringB —> “A” + “ “ + “B” / “A “ + “B”

New lines -> “\n”; print(“Uno/nDos/nTres”)

Debugging: SyntaxError and IndentationError

The Python input function -> input(prompt)
What I type after the prompt is the data that will substitute that line of code
	- print(“Hello “ + input(“What’s your name? “))

Comments: 
#This is a comment. The shortcut to include a line into a comment CMD+/. The opposite, turn a comment into a line of executable code CMD+z.

Number of characters in one string —> len(string)

Variables -> name = input(“Type the data to be store in that variable name”)

Variable Naming -> Sneak_case ; Numbers at the end, never at the beginning (SyntaxError: invalid syntax); If we type a variable name wrong or is not defined (SyntaxError: name “x” is not define).
