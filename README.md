# 100_days_of_python
I have created this repository with the aim to document my a hundred days of code with Python. 
Python is a versatile programming language which allows us to solve many different problems, that's why I got this exciting challenge.
I would like to practice as much as I can to get an introduction of Data Science, Web development, GUI Development, API, Automation, Object Oriented Programming, Game Development, Python Scripting and Web Scrapping. All of the topics mentioned before with Python. Finally, I would like to end up with a portfolio more specific in that area or field which I like the most and feel more confortable coding.
Although I have been coding in Python before, I have decided to start from the basics (zero) again.
